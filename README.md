This is my final project for a web development class.

This project essentially mimics what you would typically see on the website of a VPN service provider.

This project is built with PHP and HTML backed by the Bootstrap library.
The VPN was built with OpenVPN running on a Debian linux server hosted on DigitalOcean.
I used the Stripe payment API along with Google's reCAPTCHA API.
The web server was Apache with a MySQL database.
